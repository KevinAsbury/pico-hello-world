# Hello World Pico

A standard hello world for the Rasberry Pi Pico micro controller. Includes a build.py file, an improvement over my blink program.

## Installation
Requires you to be familiar with working on a Rasberry Pi Pico and have a setup for doing so. I am using a second Pico setup as a debugger with pico probe.
